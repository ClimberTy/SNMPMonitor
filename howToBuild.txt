# Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) RMI Application

Important Information:
Unfortunately the application will only get new data if
it has SNMP enabled devices with the set addresses in the
snmpWalk.py. Otherwise the Java RMI application will just
read old data in from the snmpData.xml document provided.

The data shouldn't be overwritten by Python if the SNMP
data isn't gathered, it should just fail and leave the 
XML doc intact.

How to build:
from the snmpmonitor/ folder type:

# This will start the Java RMI Registry
shell> rmiregistry &

# This will build the .java files using the classpaths in
# the build.xml file provided.
shell> ant

# To start the snmpmonitor server
shell> ant startsnmpserver

# In another terminal or another ssh/telnet client type
shell> ant startsnmpclient

# The application will start and the client should connect
